# UX Best Practices with React.js

You can find the code for the free chapters of my book, UX Best Practices with React.js, in this repo.

*The book is aimed at designers wishing to learn React.js and frontend developers wanting to learn UX. I currently use [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) but I may make the book more accessible to beginners in a future iteration. It is a work-in-progress and more chapters will be added in the future.*
